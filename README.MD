### Instructions



At a command prompt run the following:

```
where:
- file_path is the _complete_ file path of the file; if it contains blanks, wrap it with double quotes
- vault_name is the name of the Glacier vault
- archive comment is optional and needs to be wrapped in double quotes (if it's ommitted then the archive is initialized with the string 'Archive for ' file_path)

```
python GlacierMPU.py "C:\Users\joebloggs\my big archive.zip" My_Vault "family photos and videos from the years in ZIP format"
```
